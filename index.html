            <h2 class="section-title">The influence of the New York Times bestsellers list</h2>
            <p class="section-text">There are multiple best-seller lists out there, and getting named to any of them is
                welcome for most authors, but the New York Times best-seller list is widely considered to be the most
                prestigious, and it’s certainly the most well-known. Achieving this recognition has a tangible impact on
                book sales, particularly for first-time writers. Data from an analysis by economics professor Alan
                Sorensen in 2004 indicated that debut authors' sales rose by 57% after making the New York Times
                best-seller list. On average, it boosted sales by around 13 to 14%.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="section-title">Why we trust the new York times Bestsellers Title</h2>
            <p class="section-text">Overall, it is a combination of the New York Times' fame and credibility and the
                sales data that makes the list so popular and desirable.
                The New York Times, as a reputable and influential media outlet, has a long-standing history of quality
                journalism and reporting, which gives people confidence in their recommendations. Readers trust the list
                because it is based on sales data and is, therefore, reflective of what is popular among readers.
                Moreover, the New York Times as a highly data-driven organization, which increases the credibility of
                their bestsellers list. The Times has been recognized as one of the most data-driven news organizations.
                The Times has invested heavily in data analysis and has built dedicated teams to work on data analytics
                and digital innovation. The company uses data-driven insights to inform decision-making, from editorial
                strategy to product development to advertising.

            <p class="aboutText">A version of this Best Sellers report appears in the March
                26, 2023 issue of The New York Times Book Review. Rankings on weekly lists reflect sales for the week
                ending March 11, 2023.</p>
            <p class="aboutText">Rankings reflect unit sales reported on a confidential basis by vendors offering a wide
                range of general interest titles published in the United States. Every week, thousands of diverse
                selling locations report their actual sales on hundreds of thousands of individual titles. The panel of
                reporting retailers is comprehensive and reflects sales in tens of thousands of stores of all sizes and
                demographics across the United States.</p>
            <p class="aboutText">The book selling universe is comprised of well-established vendors as well as emerging
                ones. The sales venues for print books include national, regional and local chains representing tens of
                thousands of storefronts; many hundreds of independent book retailers; scores of online and multimedia
                entertainment retailers; supermarkets, university, gift and big-box department stores; and newsstands.

        <div class="content">
            <p class="section-text">"The Handbook for Mortals" is at the center of a controversy over allegations of
                sales manipulation to secure a spot on the prestigious New York Times bestsellers list. The book,
                authored by Lani Sarem and published by GeekNation, has been accused of using unethical means to
                boost
                sales and secure its place on the list. This accusation was not only reported by The New York Times,
                but
                also by other prominent news outlets, such as Publishers Weekly and the Los Angeles Times. Following
                these allegations, The New York Times acknowledged "inconsistencies" in the book's sales data and
                removed it from the bestsellers list. However, Sarem and her team denied any wrongdoing and accused
                The
                New York Times of bias against independently published books. This incident has raised questions
                about
                the integrity of the bestsellers list.

            <h2 class="section-title">Let’s see how New York Times books bestsellers lists compare to another
                bestsellers list with similar methodology</h2>
            <p class="section-text">So the New York Times says that: “The appearance of a ranked title reflects the
                fact
                that sales data from reporting vendors” and “Sales are defined as completed transactions by vendors
                and
                individual end users”.</p>
            <p class="section-text">According to statista.com, Amazon Books dominates book sales almost everywhere,
                with
                67 percent of book buyers using the service. Provided that the New York Times sources books sales
                data
                from “well-established vendors as well as emerging ones”, it is safe to assume that Amazon should be
                in
                the list of vendors since they are such a dominant player in the book market.</p>

                is highly likely you are missing out on high-quality, worth-while books. Many award-winning books,
                praised by critics and loved by readers, do not make it to the list due to factors such as
                commercial
                success or genre preferences.</p>
